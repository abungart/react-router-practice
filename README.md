# React Router Practice

Taking what you have learned in lecture:

## Base Mode:

1. Add `react-router-dom` to your React GitHub assignment. Or start with a [complete app](https://github.com/PrimeAcademy/vega-github-studentlist) if your copy is not working. 

    - Add an about page
    - Add a navigation unordered list
1. Style your navigation unordered list to look like a real navigation bar
1. Watch the [Redux Intro Video](https://vimeo.com/265241005) (password: pr1me)

## Stretch Goals:

1. Go through the react-router-dom documentation and try out [nested routes](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/basic) and [route params](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/example/url-params)
